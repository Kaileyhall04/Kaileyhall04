# Final Project
For STA215 (Fall 2024), all 110 episodes of Wizards of Waverly Place were examined using 28 variables. The variables examined in this code are “conflict,” “violence,” “involvement,” “rating,” and “guest.”

# Introduction
To access and utilize the script, open “hall.R”, to access the data set open “final project data.csv”, and to access the codebook open “STA - codebook.pdf”.

# Data
In this case, a simple random sample is not needed because we collect data on the entire show, both population size and sample size = 110.

# Operationalization
“Conflict” is a qualitative variable which examines if there is a major conflict in the episode and is subjective based on personal interpretation. The coding scheme is 2 = major conflict, 1 = minor conflict, and 0 = no conflict.

“Violence” is a qualitative binary variable which examines if there is violence or bullying in the episode. The coding scheme is 1 = violence or bullying occurred and 0 = violence or bullying did not occur.

“Involvement” is a quantitative discrete variable which examines the number of main characters involved in the episode's conflict, and is measured as 1, 2, 3, etc.

“Rating” is a continuous quantitative variable which examines the number of stars (out of 10) the episode has, and is measured 0.0, 0.1, … 9.9, 10.0.

“Guest” is a discrete quantitative variable which examines the number of guest stars in the episode based on information from Wiki, measured as 0, 1, 2, etc.
